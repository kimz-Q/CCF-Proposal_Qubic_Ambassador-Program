**Wallet:** FAVIWZQYSLUQTGOQYJNQFTJNXPKDYMAOOZOHUNEOBAUXUFTEZYXPPUZCYIHE

### **Available Options:**

**Option 0:** No, I don't want

**Option 1:** Yes, approve the budget of 49bln QUBIC

The Qubic Ambassador Program is a global initiative aimed at building local communities that are passionate about Qubic. They are our boots on the ground. Qubican's (ambassadors) lead on expanding Qubic's global reach by organising local events, educating local communities, and contributing to the growth of the Qubic ecosystem by integrating more closely with the ecosystem, marketing and operation teams. At this the program has over 120 active ambassadors and over 3k members across the globe.

Cryptocurrency markets are currently experiencing downward price pressure, affecting treasury stability, project growth funding, and community morale across the broader industry.

However, for Qubic, this period represents **strategic opportunity**:

- Developer attention is shifting toward platforms with strong technical foundations rather than short-term hype.

- Competing ecosystems are investing heavily into university pipelines, technical onboarding, and global expansion.

- Qubic's deterministic computing model, unique tokenomics, and UPOW mining approach position it as a high-innovation platform in a space with limited technical differentiation.

**The focus of Season 5 is to ensure that Qubic:**

1.  Continues expanding its global footprint despite market downturns.

2.  Onboards real developers who will deploy smart contracts and applications on the network.

3.  Maintains community cohesion and momentum during low-price periods.

4.  Strengthens institutional and educational footholds (universities, incubators, dev groups).

The season covers a period of 2 months with a possible extension if the Qubic price further appreciates. We have cut our budget about 10K less than S4 as we understand PA conditions not favorable at the moment.

## **S4 Challenges & learnings**

- we found is very needed that we implement the Multisig vault protocol to make sure that funds are safely controlled as one person having the only access to the community wallet can lead to transparency issues.

- The recent price decline introduced a significant challenge to maintaining ambassador motivation and operational capacity. Several communities experienced a reduction of nearly 60% in the value of their allocated funds, impacting their ability to operate effectively. This required the implementation of specific measures to ensure financial continuity and to safeguard each community's ability to deliver on its responsibilities at an optimal level.

- Some communities naturally grow and perform faster than others. The primary factor observed is the varying backgrounds, skill sets, and leadership capabilities of their Community Leads (CLs), which directly influence how effectively each community is guided and aligned with program objectives. To address this, a more structured and criteria-based selection process for appointing the most suitable CLs is currently under review and planned for implementation.

## **Budget**

![](media/image1.png){width="6.267716535433071in" height="3.388888888888889in"}

Funds are allocated to communities on a monthly basis. We only provide funding after the agreed progression has been achieved. We will provide monthly reporting to the community in the #ambassador channel.

The expenses can be tracked here through publicly available wallets broken down by local communities too. Community Leads will own their finances but Kimz, Raziah, 1 person elected by community leads form a finance committee to make sure funding is well spent.

[Payment report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kOfbeXbwaZqNYP-77fkYWrmM_YbKnJVzW1co0BAYJmE/edit?usp=sharing)

Any funds that are left will be either carried over to the next ambassador program season or transferred back directly to the CCF.

## **Benchmark with other ambassador programs**

Ambassador Programs are popular in crypto and are funded differently depending on the size of the project and number of ambassadors. Ecosystems pushing for rapid global expansion now earmark $200 k-$500 k in stablecoins or liquid tokens per quarter. In 2025, Solana Superteam funded 500k a year. LunarStorm announced a 1M rewards sprint. The most important take away is that budgets scale with the community size and GTM goals.

## **Governance**

The Qubican program is run by some of Qubics biggest contributors. We call them Community Leads. Together they form the Qubican Quorum. Program decisions are made by Quorum. Local Community decisions are made by the Community Leads together with their workgroups. Anyone can apply to start a local community as long as the requirements are met. Below an overview of the current governance structure.

Ambassadors earn rewards by completing tasks for their community, such as creating content, newsletters, videos, organizing events, helping the ecosystem/marketing teams or other things that help grow the Qubic ecosystem. Program Managers and Community Leads are paid a monthly compensation, depending on the impact they had. Their impact is measured through the KPI's mentioned above.

Defimoma and Alber are not paid and act as liaisons for the Community Leads and ambassadors.
