## **Season 4 Expenses**

Season 4 expenses sheet provides full transparency for each community expenditure. Due to price volatility, 1st payment was already 20% less, then 2nd payment was around 45% less than budgeted price despite that we managed to work around the situation. This demonstrates responsible and efficient use of funds, with the majority directed toward high-impact areas, and Clear Priorities e.g. OKX Campaign.

## **Budget & Governance**
