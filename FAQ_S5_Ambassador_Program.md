# FAQ – S5 Ambassador Program

This document is updated regularly.

**Why do some communities receive more funding than other communities?**

Some communities receive more funding because they are of bigger strategic importance, have a track record of proven success, the experience of the Community Lead or simply the cost of labour in the particular country. The cost of labour in for example Nigeria is much lower than in South Korea or France.

**What is the funding period?**

2 months

**When does the proposal go live?**

We will open a channel for discussion ideally today. We upload to the node on Thursday/Friday.

**What is an ambassador program, in one sentence?**

A structured network of community volunteers who earn rewards for promoting, educating, and supporting the project.

**Why not just rely on paid marketing?**

Ambassadors deliver authentic, peer-to-peer advocacy that paid ads cannot replicate, boosting credibility and organic reach.

**How does it grow the community?**

Ambassadors support the ecosystem team with business introductions, localize content, host meet-ups, and answer questions in real time, onboarding new users faster than the core team ever could.

**Isn't it expensive?**

It's surprisingly cost-efficient: modest token or stipend rewards scale far further than agency retainers while creating long-term holders.

The different phases of community maturity offer Qubic multiple partnerships and proof of return on investment.

**What specific value do ambassadors add?**

Business introductions to companies, academia and institutions.
Content creation (blogs, videos, memes, tutorials)
Localization of docs and social channels
Community support and moderation in Discord/Telegram
Event organization (AMAs, hackathons, meet-ups)
onboarding Devs group.
supporting Ecosystem by building Dapps/Sc.

**How will you manage for example, incorrect X posts?**

If posts include incorrect numbers, Community Leads actively reach out to the ambassador and will ask them to update their post while also educating them where to find the correct information.

**What if I don't like the style of an ambassador X post?**

Ambassadors have creative freedom in what style they want to post. Some write long analyses while others write more sales messages. We think a balance is important and will step in if an ambassador is "shilling" too much or if untruths are written.

**How does it help decentralization?**

Knowledge shifts from a single core team to hundreds of trusted community members distributed across time zones.

**What about developer adoption?**

Dev-centric ambassadors can run workshops and hopefully soon local hackathons.

**Can it improve retention?**

Yes. Active contributors feel ownership, turning from casual users into long-term evangelists who stay engaged through market cycles.

**What risks should we watch?**

Over-incentivizing "shilling," unclear guidelines, and brand dilution. Mitigate with tiered rewards, clear KPIs, and regular monthly reviews.

**What is the Code of Conduct?**

All Ambassadors agree with the [Qubican Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JusVxQgzAgmzPBJWUKzpQYl7tkJNNmJANPszoTHCZv4/edit?usp=sharing) before they join the program. Failing to comply will result in a warning or expulsion from the Ambassador Program.

**Is the Ambassador Program actually useful?**
Yes. After more than a year of consistent operation, the program has demonstrated clear, measurable impact. A prime example is the OKX campaign, where the majority of verified sign-ups originated directly from ambassador communities.

**Why don’t ambassadors work voluntarily?**
Expanding Qubic in 11 global regions requires real operational effort,organizing events, producing content, driving local growth, and onboarding new users and developers. These actions carry costs. Like all reputable ambassador programs in the crypto space , incentives are essential to attract and retain committed contributors.

**With the market down, why spend CCF funds now?**
We are highly aware of market conditions.
For Season 5:
- We reduced total expenses by  $20k compared to S4.
- We budgeted at 1k USD/bln, absorbing a ~30% reduction ourselves.
- We self-funded November activities without requesting support.

**How do you ensure transparency and accountability?**
All community payments are publicly trackable through the shared expense sheet. Additionally, the accountability structure is clear:
PMs → CLs → Ambassadors,
and funds are withheld in cases of underperformance.

**The program used to be cheap. Why is the cost now similar to other workgroups?**
The program has grown significantly in scope, community size, and output. Increased activity naturally requires increased resources. Even today, our cost remains below industry standards for programs with similar scale and reach.

**Is the program centralized?**
We operate through a structured system:
- A central HQ Discord for coordination
- Community Leads and PMs aligned through weekly discussions
- A quorum where all CLs vote on major decisions
This ensures quality, continuity, and alignment, while preventing any single entity from dominating the program. so it's an advantage not dis advantage.

**What about people who contribute without incentives?**
We appreciate all organic contributors but it's personal choice , and anyone is welcome to join formally if they want access to resources, training, and structured tasks with incentive.

**How do you count X impressions, and how is quality ensured?**
Each Community Lead consolidates metrics using X Analytics, which provides verified engagement data.To ensure quality, we conduct:
- Training on content creation and writing
- Guidance on tools like Canva
- Continuous feedback on post structure and messaging

**How does the ambassador program support events?**
We operate on two tiers:
- Major events: We provide logistical support, merchandise, hackathon coordination, and facilitate official participation when event costs exceed community budgets.
- Local events: Communities independently organize meetups for recruitment, education, and brand awareness within their allocated budget.
