# FAQ – S5 Ambassador Program

FAQ SO5 Ambassador Program

This document is updated regularly. 

 
Why do some communities receive more funding than	 other communities?
Some communities receive more funding because they are of bigger strategic importance, have a track record of proven success, the experience of the Community Lead or simply the cost of labour in the particular country. The cost of labour in for example Nigeria is much lower than in South Korea or France. 

What is the funding period?
2 months

When does the proposal go live?
We will open a channel for discussion ideally today. We upload to the node on Thursday/Friday.
What is an ambassador program, in one sentence?
A structured network of community volunteers who earn rewards for promoting, educating, and supporting the project.
Why not just rely on paid marketing?
Ambassadors deliver authentic, peer-to-peer advocacy that paid ads cannot replicate, boosting credibility and organic reach.
How does it grow the community?
Ambassadors support the ecosystem team with business introductions, localize content, host meet-ups, and answer questions in real time, onboarding new users faster than the core team ever could.
Isn’t it expensive?
It’s surprisingly cost-efficient: modest token or stipend rewards scale far further than agency retainers while creating long-term holders.
The different phases of community maturity offer Qubic multiple partnerships and proof of return on investment.

How will you manage for example, incorrect X posts?
If posts include incorrect numbers, Community Leads actively reach out to the ambassador and will ask them to update their post while also educating them where to find the correct information. 

What if I don’t like the style of an ambassador X post?
Ambassadors have creative freedom in what style they want to post. Some write long analyses while others write more sales messages. We think a balance is important and will step in if an ambassador is “shilling” too much or if untruths are written.
How does it help decentralization?
Knowledge shifts from a single core team to hundreds of trusted community members distributed across time zones.
What about developer adoption?
Dev-centric ambassadors can run workshops and hopefully soon local hackathons.
Can it improve retention?
Yes. Active contributors feel ownership, turning from casual users into long-term evangelists who stay engaged through market cycles.
What risks should we watch?
Over-incentivizing “shilling,” unclear guidelines, and brand dilution. Mitigate with tiered rewards, clear KPIs, and regular monthly reviews.
What is the Code of Conduct?
All Ambassadors agree with the  before they join the program. Failing to comply will result in a warning or expulsion from the Ambassador Program.
